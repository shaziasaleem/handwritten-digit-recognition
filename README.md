# handwritten-digit-recognition
CNN based handwritten digit recognition
   The goal of this project is to create a model that will be able to recognize and determine the handwritten digits from its image by using the concept of Convolution Neural Network(CNN).
FACILITIES REQUIRED FOR PROPOSED WORK:
-Python modules(Keras, cv2, numpy)
-Tkinter( module for GUI)
-60,000 samples of MNIST Database
-Windows Operating System 7(64 bit)
METHODOLOGY:
-Loading MNIST database
-Scan the live image using webcam
-Convert the coloured image into gray scale.
-Create model using CNN.
-convert model into json file
-Test model.
-Create GUI for better interface.
